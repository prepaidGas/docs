# Creating Order

It is required to place order conditions onchain regarding the execution timeframe, gas price, and the expected security from the Executor, also the Purchaser locks the reward tokens responsible of paying the gas: `gasCost * gasAmount`.

The gas Order should include such fields:

```solidity
struct GasPayment {
    address token;
    uint256 perUnit;
}

struct Order {
    address manager;
    uint256 gas;
    uint256 expire;
    uint256 start;
    uint256 end;
    uint256 txWindow;
    uint256 redeemWindow;
    GasPayment gasPrice;
    GasPayment gasGuarantee;
}
```
