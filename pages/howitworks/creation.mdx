# Creating Order

It is required to place order conditions onchain regarding the execution timeframe, gas price, and the expected security from the Executor, also the Purchaser locks the reward tokens responsible of paying the gas: gasCost * gasAmount.

The GasOrder should include such fields:

```solidity
struct GasOrder {
    uint256 gasAmount; // The amount of Gas to book for future executions
    uint256 executionPeriodStart; // Start timestamp when it is possible to use the gas within the order
    uint256 executionPeriodDeadline; // End timestamp when it is possible to use the gas within the order
    uint256 executionWindow; // This variable defines a window, measured in blocks, within which a
    // transaction must be executed. This constraint is designed to optimize timing and prevent delays, while 
    // also safeguarding against the exploitation of gas price fluctuations by malicious actors.
    TokenTransfer gasCost; // The cost of one Gas unit
    TokenTransfer guarantee; // The guarantee security required from the Executor
}
```
