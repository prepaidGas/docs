# Liquidation

If the transaction is not fulfilled by the *Executor* upon request of the *Purchaser*, anyone may execute the transaction and receive a share of the security locked by the *Executor*. The share of the security is proportional to the gas required to execute the transaction compared to the whole ordered gas.

The *Purchaser* may also act as a *Liquidator*.

To ensure that transactions are executed, we recommend specifying significant security.
